Setting up and Running the Project
----------------------------------
Clone the repository:

```https://github.com/ManabuAzai/pointcloud.git```

Navigate to the cloned directory:

```cd pointcloud```

Install the required dependencies:

```npm install```

Run the development server:

```npm run dev```

Upon successfully executing these steps, a local server should start, typically at port 5173. You should then be able to view the point cloud visualization in your browser.
